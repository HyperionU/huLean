World "Addition"
Title "Addition World"

Introduction
"
Welcome to Addition World! In this world we'll learn the `induction` tactic.
This will enable us to defeat the boss level of this world, namely `x + y = y + x`.

The tactics `rw`, `rfl` and `induction` are the only tactics you'll need to
beat all the levels in Addition World, Multiplication World, and Power World.
Power World contains the final boss of the game.

There are plenty more tactics in this game, but you'll only need to know them if you
want to explore the game further (for example if you decide to 100%
the game).
