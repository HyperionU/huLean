# Logic in Lean: implies (`→`)

We learn about propositions, and implications `P → Q` between them. You can get
this arrow by typing `\to` or `\r`. Mathematicians usually write the
implication arrow as `P ⇒ Q` but Lean prefers a single arrow.

## The absolute basics

`P : Prop` means that `P` is a true-false statement. `h : P` means
that `h` is a proof that `P` is true, or you can regard `h` as an
assumption that `P` is true; logically these are the same. Stuff above
the `⊢` symbol is your assumptions. The statement to the right of it is
the goal. Your job is to prove the goal from the assumptions.

## Tactics you will need

To solve the next five levels (and first five levels in Advanced Logic World), you will need to know how to use the
following tactics:

* `intro`
* `exact`
* `apply`

Conclusion
"
Note that `→` is not associative: in general `P → (Q → R)` and `(P → Q) → R`
might not be equivalent. This is like subtraction on numbers -- in general
`a - (b - c)` and `(a - b) - c` might not be equal.

So if we write `P → Q → R` then we'd better know what this means.
The convention in Lean is that it means `P → (Q → R)`. If you think
about it, this means that to deduce `R` you will need to prove both `P`
and `Q`. In general to prove `P1 → P2 → P3 → ... Pn` you can assume
`P1`, `P2`,...,`P(n-1)` and then you have to prove `Pn`.
