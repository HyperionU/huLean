World "Implication"
Title "Implication World"

Introduction
"
We've proved that $2+2=4$; in Implication World we'll learn
how to prove $2+2\\neq 5$.

In Addition World we proved *equalities* like $x + y = y + x$.
In this second tutorial world we'll learn some new tactics,
enabling us to prove *implications*
like $x+1=4 \\implies x=3.$

We'll also learn two new fundamental facts about
natural numbers, which Peano introduced as axioms.
