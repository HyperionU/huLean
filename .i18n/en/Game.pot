"If `h` is a proof of an equality `X = Y`, then `rw [h]` will change\n"
"all `X`s in the goal to `Y`s. It's the way to \\\"substitute in\\\".\n"
"\n"
"## Variants\n"
"\n"
"* `rw [‚Üê h]` (changes `Y`s to `X`s; get the back arrow by typing `\\left ` or `\\l`.)\n"
"\n"
"* `rw [h1, h2]` (a sequence of rewrites)\n"
"\n"
"* `rw [h] at h2` (changes `X`s to `Y`s in hypothesis `h2`)\n"
"\n"
"* `rw [h] at h1 h2 ‚ä¢` (changes `X`s to `Y`s in two hypotheses and the goal;\n"
"get the `‚ä¢` symbol with `\\|-`.)\n"
"\n"
"* `repeat rw [add_zero]` will keep changing `? + 0` to `?`\n"
"until there are no more matches for `? + 0`.\n"
"\n"
"* `nth_rewrite 2 [h]` will change only the second `X` in the goal to `Y`.\n"
"\n"
"### Example:\n"
"\n"
"If you have the assumption `h : x = y + y` and your goal is\n"
"```\n"
"succ (x + 0) = succ (y + y)\n"
"```\n"
"\n"
"then\n"
"\n"
"`rw [add_zero]`\n"
"\n"
"will change the goal into `succ x = succ (y + y)`, and then\n"
"\n"
"`rw [h]`\n"
"\n"
"will change the goal into `succ (y + y) = succ (y + y)`, which\n"
"can be solved with `rfl`.\n"
"\n"
"### Example:\n"
"\n"
"You can use `rw` to change a hypothesis as well.\n"
"For example, if you have two hypotheses\n"
"```\n"
"h1 : x = y + 3\n"
"h2 : 2 * y = x\n"
"```\n"
"then `rw [h1] at h2` will turn `h2` into `h2 : 2 * y = y + 3`.\n"
"\n"
"## Common errors\n"
"\n"
"* You need the square brackets. `rw h` is never correct.\n"
"\n"
"* If `h` is not a *proof* of an *equality* (a statement of the form `A = B`),\n"
"for example if `h` is a function or an implication,\n"
"then `rw` is not the tactic you want to use. For example,\n"
"`rw [P = Q]` is never correct: `P = Q` is the theorem *statement*,\n"
"not the proof. If `h : P = Q` is the proof, then `rw [h]` will work.\n"
"\n"
"## Details\n"
"\n"
"The `rw` tactic is a way to do \\\"substituting in\\\". There\n"
"are two distinct situations where you can use this tactic.\n"
"\n"
"1) Basic usage: if `h : A = B` is an assumption or\n"
"the proof of a theorem, and if the goal contains one or more `A`s, then `rw [h]`\n"
"will change them all to `B`s. The tactic will error\n"
"if there are no `A`s in the goal.\n"
"\n"
"2) Advanced usage: Assumptions coming from theorem proofs\n"
"often have missing pieces. For example `add_zero`\n"
"is a proof that `? + 0 = ?` because `add_zero` really is a function,\n"
"and `?` is the input. In this situation `rw` will look through the goal\n"
"for any subterm of the form `x + 0`, and the moment it\n"
"finds one it fixes `?` to be `x` then changes all `x + 0`s to `x`s.\n"
"\n"
"Exercise: think about why `rw [add_zero]` changes the term\n"
"`(0 + 0) + (x + 0) + (0 + 0) + (x + 0)` to\n"
"`0 + (x + 0) + 0 + (x + 0)`\n"
"\n"
"If you can't remember the name of the proof of an equality, look it up in\n"
"the list of lemmas on the right.\n"
"\n"
"## Targetted usage\n"
"\n"
"If your goal is `b + c + a = b + (a + c)` and you want to rewrite `a + c`\n"
"to `c + a`, then `rw [add_comm]` will not work because Lean finds another\n"
"addition first and swaps those inputs instead. Use `rw [add_comm a c]` to\n"
"guarantee that Lean rewrites `a + c` to `c + a`. This works because\n"
"`add_comm` is a proof that `?1 + ?2 = ?2 + ?1`, `add_comm a` is a proof\n"
"that `a + ? = ? + a`, and `add_comm a c` is a proof that `a + c = c + a`.\n"
"\n"
"If `h : X = Y` then `rw [h]` will turn all `X`s into `Y`s.\n"
"If you only want to change the 37th occurrence of `X`\n"
"to `Y` then do `nth_rewrite 37 [h]`."
